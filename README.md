# Communication-Systems-Course
This contains all of my projects during 6 month attending in CS course most related to implementing modulator & detector to determine how we use modulated signal to transfer information during communication channels , Furthermore recommends ways to improve the functionality of modulator systems .



## Abstract: <br>
> In "Question 1" we are gonna learn about $stationary \hspace{2mm} points$, the procedure of finding and classifying them using $Hessian\hspace{2mm} matrix$ .<br><br>
> In "Question 2" we are gonna find the  $step size$ using two different approaches and comparing them.<br><br>
> In "Question 3" we are gonna learn how to classify a multiclass problem using $one\hspace{2mm} vs. \hspace{2mm}all$ also avoid overfitting using $L1 \hspace{2mm}regularization$<br><br>
> Finally, in "Question 4" we are gonna use KNN to classify
